# Talent-Analytics
During my time in my previous company, I saw a repeating pattern in which the organisation frequently hired external applicants for specific tasks without thoroughly evaluating the skill sets of existing personnel. This method cost the company a lot of money, forcing it to lay off staff in order to cut expenditures. Recognizing a gap in the company's people management strategy, I was inspired to use my interest in data analytics to fix it.
Analytic Approach:

Driven by my interest in data analytics, I went on an analytical quest to discover insights that could improve the company's talent acquisition process. I began by analysing data from the talent acquisition team, which was collected through platforms such as Kaggle. Using statistical approaches and Python programming, I created an employee ontology file that functioned as a comprehensive repository for staff abilities and competences.

Technical Skills Applied:

Data Analysis: Leveraging Python and statistical methods, I dissected the talent acquisition data to identify patterns and trends in the hiring process.

Python Programming: Through Python scripting, I automated the extraction and transformation of data, enabling seamless analysis and visualization.

Statistical Techniques: Employing statistical methods, I conducted robust analyses to derive actionable insights from the data, informing strategic decisions.

Ontology Development: Utilizing my expertise in data science, I constructed an employee ontology file, categorizing and cataloging employee skills and qualifications.

Outcome:

By combining my technical expertise with a thorough understanding of organisational dynamics, I hoped to bridge the gap between talent acquisition and internal skill utilisation. My effort highlighted not just my devotion to process optimisation, but also my ability to apply new solutions to real-world problems.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, my efforts to improve the talent acquisition process using data-driven insights show my enthusiasm for using technology to increase organisational efficiency. I am excited to apply my analytical talents and data science knowledge to help your organisation succeed.
